This is a little sketch of a web app for flipping through cards. You can drag
them to the left to flip through, and any that you find interesting you can
drag up instead. Currently that's all the UI there is :)

This exercises a few compositor paths that are currently really slow on mobile
devices, which is really where I wanted this to work well. It's especially slow
on Firefox for Android, even on my Galaxy Nexus. Chrome for Android does
better, but it's still really laggy. Native Android apps can do this sort of
thing with ease (see for example Chrome's tab switching UI). It's a shame that
web tech isn't up to scratch.
